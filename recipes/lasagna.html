        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat;<br>
                cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic,<br>
                basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer,<br>
                stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water<br>
                to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally,<br>
                until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.<br>
                While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh<br>
                parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.
            </li>
            <li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of<br>
                a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles<br>
                over the sauce to cover.
            </li>
            <li>Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce,<br>
                and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using<br>
                the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella.<br>
                Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and<br>
                bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
