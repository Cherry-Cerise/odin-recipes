        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a recipe for pizza dough. In just 45 minutes, you can make your own pizza dough<br>
           from scratch and add toppings of your choice!
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>2 Â½ cups bread flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), and<br>
                lightly grease a pizza pan.
            </li>
            <li>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until<br>
                creamy, about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do<br>
                this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it<br>
                easier.
            </li>
            <li>Let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle. </li>
            <li>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</li>
            <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove<br>
                from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
            </li>
        </ol>
